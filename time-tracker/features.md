# Feature Requests

This document tracks the features for the website. These have been split in to different categories depending on their priority.

## Essential

- Some form of login so times can be attributed to an individual
  * We don't need passwords, just a way for a user to provide their username (and maybe a display name)
- Pull Circle 9 times from local storage (after the user has transfered them across with the extension) and write to the database
- The ability to see your records for each game

## Important

- Global leaderboards
- See your times over time

## Nice to Have

- Communities where you can compare times against a sub-set of friends
- A more user-friendly way to pull the times from Circle9 without using the local storage transfer extension(though this probably necessitates our own Chrome extension, which is a lot more work).
